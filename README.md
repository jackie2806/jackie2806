### Hi there! 👋
 👨🏻‍💻 I really like discovering ideas through reading, which has allowed me to develop my critical thinking. From the legal sector I moved to the technological sector, out of pure innate curiosity, when I wrote my first "Hello World" in JavaScript; since then I have not stopped reading and writing code.  ⭐️
